    "of the value function at every $w <\\hat{\\omega}_{t,1}$.  In particular, note that the original consumption function is\n",

    "be greater before than after imposition of the new constraint at this particular level of wealth.\n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition is simple: At levels of initial wealth below $\\hat{\\omega}_{t,1}$, the consumer had been planning to end\n",

    "$\\omega_{t,1}$. But the reason $\\omega_{t,1}$ was a kink point in the initial situation was that it was the level of\n",
    "wealth where consumption would have been equal to wealth in period $t+1$. Now, because of the extra savings induced by\n",
    "the constraint in $t+2$, the larger savings induced by wealth $\\omega_{t,1}$ implies that the period $t+1$ constraint\n",
    "will no longer bind for a consumer who begins period $t$ with wealth $\\omega_{t,1}$. In other words, at wealth\n",

    "Notice, however, that all constraints that existed in $\\mathcal{T}$ will remain relevant at *some* level of\n",
