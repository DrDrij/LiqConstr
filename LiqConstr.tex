  \section{Proof of Theorem \ref{thm:riskandconstraints}}\label{app:riskandconstraints}

  \begin{proof}
                               %%                                Old: We prove Theorem \ref{thm:riskandconstraints} by induction. We first show that it holds when we introduce the first constraint, before we show that it holds when we introduce constraint number $n+1$ when $n$ constraints already exist.

                  %%                   Old:   Consider an agent who has a utility function with $u'> 0$, $u''< 0$, $u''' > 0$, and non-increasing absolute prudence ($-u'''/u''$). Then

                  %%                   Old:   \end{equation}
                  %%                   Old:   and the inequality is strict if ${m}_{t} < \bar{\wAlt}_{t,1}$.
                  %%                   Old: \end{lemma}

    Our proof proceeds by constructing the behavior of consumers facing the risk from the behavior of the corresponding perfect foresight consumers.  We consider matters from the perspective of some level of wealth ${{m}}$ for the perfect foresight consumers.  Because the same marginal utility function $u'$ applies to all four consumption rules, the Compensating Precautionary Premia, $\kappa_{t,n}$ and $\kappa_{t,n+1}$, associated with the introduction of the risk $\zeta_{t+1}$  must satisfy
    \begin{eqnarray}
      c_{t,n}({{m}}) & = & \tilde{c}_{t,n}({{m}}+\kappa_{t,n}) \label{eq:hateqtildehat2}
      \\ c_{t,n+1}({{m}}) & = & \tilde{c}_{t,n+1}({{m}}+\kappa_{t,n+1}). \label{eq:hateqtildehat}\end{eqnarray}
    Define the amounts of precautionary saving induced by the risk $\zeta_{t+1}$ at an arbitrary level of wealth ${m}$ in the two cases as
    \begin{eqnarray}
      \psi_{t,n}({m}) & = & c_{t,n}({m})-\tilde{c}_{t,n}({m})
      \\   \psi_{t,n+1}({m}) & = & c_{t,n+1}({m})-\tilde{c}_{t,n+1}({m})
    \end{eqnarray}
    where the mnemonic is that the first two letters of the Greek letter psi stand
    for {\bf p}recautionary {\bf s}aving.

    We can rewrite \eqref{eq:hateqtildehat} (resp. \eqref{eq:hateqtildehat2}) as
    \begin{eqnarray*}
      c_{t,n+1}({m}) = c_{t,n+1}({{m}}+\kappa_{t,n+1})+\int_{{{m}}+\kappa_{t,n+1}}^{{{m}}} c_{t,n+1}^{\prime}(\mu) d\mu  = \tilde{c}_{t,n+1}({{m}}+\kappa_{t,n+1})
      \psi_{t,2}({{m}}+\kappa_{t,2}) \equiv 
    \end{eqnarray*}
    which implies that
    \begin{eqnarray*}
      \psi_{t,n+1}({{m}}+\kappa_{t,n+1}) & = & 
                                               c_{t,n+1}({{m}}+\kappa_{t,n+1})-\tilde{c}_{t,n+1}({{m}}+\kappa_{t,n+1}) = \int^{{{m}}+\kappa_{t,n+1}}_{{{m}}} c_{t,n+1}^{\prime}(\mu) d\mu,
      \\ %\psi_{t,1}({{m}}+\kappa_{t,1}) \equiv 
      \psi_{t,n}({{m}}+\kappa_{t,n}) & = &  c_{t,n}({{m}}+\kappa_{t,n})-\tilde{c}_{t,n}({{m}}+\kappa_{t,n}) = \int^{{{m}}+\kappa_{t,n}}_{{{m}}} c_{t,n}^{\prime}(\mu) d\mu 
    \end{eqnarray*}
    and 
    \begin{eqnarray}
      \psi_{t,n}({{m}}+\kappa_{t,n+1}) & = & 
                                             \psi_{t,n}({{m}}+\kappa_{t,n}) - \int^{{{m}}+\kappa_{t,n+1}}_{{{m}}+\kappa_{t,n}} (\tilde{c}_{t,n}^{\prime}(\mu)-c_{t,n}^{\prime}(\mu)) d\mu \nonumber
    \end{eqnarray}
    so the difference between precautionary saving for the consumer facing $n$ constraints and the one facing $n+1$ constraints at ${{m}}+\kappa_{t,n+1}$ is 
    \begin{align}
      \psi_{t,n+1}&({{m}}+\kappa_{t,n+1}) - \psi_{t,n}({{m}}+\kappa_{t,n+1}) = \nonumber\\ 
                  &= \psi_{t,n+1}({{m}}+\kappa_{t,n+1}) - \psi_{t,n}({{m}}+\kappa_{t,n}) + \psi_{t,n}({{m}}+\kappa_{t,n})- \psi_{t,n}({{m}}+\kappa_{t,n+1}) \nonumber
      \\ &=\int_{{{m}}}^{{{m}}+\kappa_{t,n+1}} c_{t,n+1}^{\prime}(\mu)d\mu - \int^{{{m}}+\kappa_{t,n}}_{{{m}}} c_{t,n}^{\prime}(\mu) d\mu + \int^{{{m}}+\kappa_{t,n+1}}_{{{m}}+\kappa_{t,n}} (\tilde{c}_{t,n}^{\prime}(\mu)-c_{t,n}^{\prime}(\mu)) d\mu \nonumber\\
      % &=\int_{{{m}}}^{{{m}}+\kappa_{t,n}} (c_{t,n+1}^{\prime}(\mu)-c_{t,n}^{\prime}(\mu))d\mu+\int^{{{m}}+\kappa_{t,n+1}}_{{{m}}+\kappa_{t,n}} \left(c_{t,n+1}^{\prime}(\mu)+(\tilde{c}_{t,n}^{\prime}(\mu)-c_{t,n}^{\prime}(\mu)) \right) d\mu \nonumber \\
                  &= \int_{{{m}}}^{{{m}}+\kappa_{t,n+1}}
                    (c_{t,n+1}^{\prime}(\mu)-c_{t,n}^{\prime}(\mu))d\mu +\int^{{{m}}+\kappa_{t,n+1}}_{{{m}}+\kappa_{t,n}}
                    \tilde{c}_{t,n}^{\prime}(\mu) d\mu \label{eq:psidiffint}
    \end{align}


    If we can show that \eqref{eq:psidiffint} is a positive
    number for all feasible levels of ${{m}}$ satisfying ${{m}} < {\bar{\wAlt}}_{t,n+1}$, then we have proven Theorem \ref{thm:riskandconstraints}. We know that the marginal propensity to consume is always strictly positive and that $\kappa_{t,n+1} \geq \kappa_{t,n} \geq 0$\footnote{Since we know that liquidity constraints increase prudence (Corollary \ref{cor:lcip}) and that prudence results in a positive precautionary premium (Lemma \ref{lemma:kimpratt}).} so to prove that \eqref{eq:psidiffint} is strictly positive, we need to show one of two sufficient conditions:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item $\kappa_{t,n+1} > 0$ and $c_{t,n+1}'(\mu) > c_{t,n}'(\mu)$
    \item $\kappa_{t,n+1} > \kappa_{t,n}$
    \end{enumerate}
    Now, since $u'''>0$, we know that $\kappa_{t,n} > 0$ from Jensen's inequality. Hence, $\kappa_{t,n+1} > 0$ since $\kappa_{t,n+1} \geq \kappa_{t,n}$. The first integral in \eqref{eq:psidiffint} is therefore strictly positive as long as $c_{t,n+1}' > c_{t,n}'$, which is true for ${{m}} < \wAlt_{t,n+1}$ by Lemma \ref{lem:LcAndCc}. 
    
    For ${{m}} \geq \wAlt_{t,n+1}$, we know that $c_{t,n+1}' = c_{t,n}'$ so the first integral in \eqref{eq:psidiffint} is always zero. For the second integral in \eqref{eq:psidiffint} to be strictly positive, we need to show that $\kappa_{t,n+1} > \kappa_{t,n}$. 
    
                    %%                     Old: We will prove this by using a proof by showing that assuming $\kappa_{t,n+1} \leq \kappa_{t,n}$ leads to the conclusion that $\kappa_{t,n+1} > \kappa_{t,n}$. 
    
                    %                     First define $\hat{\zeta}$ as the realization of $\zeta$ such that 
                    %                     $$ {a}_{t,n+1} + y + \kappa_{t,n+1} + \zeta = \omega_{t,n+1}.$$
                    %                     In words, $\hat{\zeta}$ is the value of $\zeta$ that cancels the values of ${a}_{t,n+1}$ and $\kappa_{t,n+1}$ relative to the $n+1$'st constraint in the sense that given the level of savings and precautionary premia, a draw if $\zeta = \hat{\zeta}$ restores wealth to exactly the value at which constraint $n+1$ stops binding. 
                    %                     XXXXX
    
    
    
    First define the perfect foresight consumption functions as
    \begin{eqnarray}
      c(\kappa_{t,n}+\zeta) & = & c_{t+1,n}(\overbrace{{s}_{t,n}}^{={a}_{t,n+1}}+{y}+\kappa_{t,n}+\zeta) \label{eq:cnoconstr}
      \\  {c}(\kappa_{t,n+1}+\zeta) & = & c_{t+1,n+1}({s}_{t,n+1}+{y}+\kappa_{t,n+1}+\zeta)\label{eq:gravecnoconstr}.
    \end{eqnarray}	
    where ${a}_{t,n} = {a}_{t,n+1}$ since ${m} \geq \wAlt_{t,n+1}$. Recall also the definitions of $\kappa_{t,n}$ and $\kappa_{t,n+1}$:
    \begin{eqnarray*}
      u'({c}_{t,n}) & = & \Ex_{t}[u'(c(\kappa_{t,n}+\zeta))]
      \\  u'({c}_{t,n+1}) & = & \Ex_{t}[u'({c}(\kappa_{t,n+1}+\zeta))].
    \end{eqnarray*}

    Now recall that Lemma~\ref{lemma:kimpratt} tells us that if absolute prudence of $u'(c(\kappa_{t,n}+\zeta))$ is identical to absolute prudence of $u'({c}(\kappa_{t,n+1}+\zeta))$ for every realization of $\zeta$, then $\kappa_{t,n}=\kappa_{t,n+1}$. This is true if ${m}_{t+1} \geq \wAlt_{t+1,n+1}$ for all possible realizations of $\zeta \in (\underline{\zeta}, \bar{\zeta})$, i.e. that the agent is unconstrained for all realizations of the risk. We defined this limit as ${m}_{t+1} \geq {\bar{\wAlt}}_{t+1,n+1}$. We therefore know that $\kappa_{t,n+1}  = \kappa_{t,n}$ if ${{m}} \geq {\bar{\wAlt}}_{t+1,n+1}$. 
    
    For all levels of wealth below this limit (${{m}} < {\bar{\wAlt}}_{t+1,n+1}$), there exist realizations of $\zeta$ such that constraint $n+1$ will bind in period $t+1$. The agent will require a higher precautionary premia when facing constraint $n+1$ in addition to the $n$ constraints already in the set, implying that $\kappa_{t,n+1} > \kappa_{t,n}$. Equation \eqref{eq:psidiffint} is therefore strictly positive if ${{m}} < {\bar{\wAlt}}_{t+1,n+1}$ and we have proven Theorem \ref{thm:riskandconstraints}.

Similar to the introduction of the first constraint, we need to show that the following equation is strictly positive:

This can only be true if ${m}_{t+1} \geq \wAlt_{t+1,n+1}$ for any realization of $\zeta \in (\underline{\zeta}, \bar{\zeta})$. We defined this limit as ${m}_{t+1} \geq {\bar{\wAlt}}_{t,n+1}$. We therefore know that $\kappa_{t,n+1}  = \kappa_{t,n}$ if ${{m}} \geq {\bar{\wAlt}}_{t,n+1}$ and $\kappa_{t,n+1} > \kappa_{t,n}$ if ${{m}} < {\bar{\wAlt}}_{t,n+1}$. Equation \eqref{eq:psidiffint2} is therefore strictly positive if ${{m}} < {\bar{\wAlt}}_{t,n+1}$ and we have proven Theorem \ref{thm:riskandconstraints}.

  \section{Resemblance Between Precautionary Saving and a Liquidity Constraint} \label{app:similar}

  This appendix repeats an illustration from appendix G of \cite{BufferStockTheory}.  (We make no claim to novelty of this point; it is here only to aid the intuition of the reader).

  In this appendix, we provide an example where the introduction of risk resembles the introduction of a constraint. Consider the second-to-last period of life for two risk-averse CRRA utility consumers and assume for simplicity that $R=\beta=1$.

  The first consumer is subject to a liquidity constraint $c_{T-1} \geq {m}_{T-1}$, and earns non-stochastic income of ${y}=1$ in period $T$. This consumer's saving rule will be 
  \begin{equation*}
    {a}_{T-1,1}({m}_{T-1}) =
    \begin{cases}
      0   & \mbox{if ${m}_{T-1} \leq 1$}
      \\    ({m}_{T-1}-1)/2 & \mbox{if ${m}_{T-1} > 1$}.
    \end{cases}
  \end{equation*}

  The second consumer is not subject to a liquidity constraint, but 
  faces a stochastic income process,
  \begin{equation*}
    y_{T} = 
    \begin{cases}
      0 & \mbox{with probability $p$}
      \\ \frac{1}{1-p} & \mbox{with probability $(1-p)$}.
    \end{cases}
  \end{equation*}

  If we write the consumption rule for the unconstrained consumer facing the risk as $\tilde{s}_{T-1,0},$ the key result is that in the limit as $p \downarrow 0$, behavior of the two consumers becomes the same. That is, defining $\tilde{s}_{T-1,0}({m})$ as the optimal saving rule for the consumer facing the risk,
  \begin{equation*}
    \lim_{p \downarrow 0} \tilde{s}_{T-1,0}({m}_{T-1}) = {a}_{T-1,1}({m}_{T-1}) \label{eq:lim0}
  \end{equation*}
  for every ${m}_{T-1}$.

  To see this, start with the Euler equations for the two consumers given wealth ${m}$,
  \begin{eqnarray}
    u'({m}-{a}_{T-1,1}({m})) & = & u'({a}_{T-1,1}({m})+1) \label{eq:euler1}
    \\   u'({m}-\tilde{s}_{T-1,0}({m})) & = & p u'(\tilde{s}_{T-1,0}({m}))+(1-p) u'(\tilde{s}_{T-1,0}({m})+1). \label{eq:euler2}
  \end{eqnarray}

  Consider first the case where ${m}$ is large enough that the constraint does not bind for the constrained consumer, ${m}>1$.  In this case the limit of the Euler equation for the second consumer is identical to the Euler equation for the first consumer (because for ${m}>1$ savings are positive for the consumer facing the risk, implying that the limit of the first $u'$ term on the RHS of \eqref{eq:euler2} is finite). Thus the limit of \eqref{eq:euler2} is \eqref{eq:euler1} for ${m}>1$.

  Now consider the case where ${m} < 1$ so that the first consumer would be constrained.  This consumer spends her entire resources ${m}$, and by the definition of the constraint we know that 
  \begin{eqnarray}
    u'({m}) > u'(1). \label{eq:upw}
  \end{eqnarray}

  Now consider the consumer facing the risk. If this consumer were to save exactly zero and then experienced the bad shock in period $T$, she would have an infinite marginal utility (the Inada condition). This cannot satisfy the Euler-equation as long as ${m}>0$. Therefore we know that for any $p>0$ and any ${m}>0$ the consumer will save some positive amount. For a fixed ${m}$, hypothesize that there is some $\delta>0$ such that no matter how small $p$ became the consumer would always choose to save at least $\delta$. But for any $\delta$, the limit of the RHS of \eqref{eq:euler2} is $u'(1+\delta)$. We know from concavity of the utility function that $u'(1+\delta) < u'(1)$ and we know from~\eqref{eq:upw} that $u'({m}) > u'(1) > u'(1+\delta)$, so as $p \downarrow 0$ there must always come a point at which the consumer can improve her total utility by shifting some resources from the future to the present, i.e. by saving less.  Since this argument holds for any $\delta>0$ it demonstrates that as $p$ goes to zero there is no positive level of saving that would make the consumer better off. But saving of zero or a negative amount is ruled out by the Inada condition at $u'(0)$.  Hence saving must approach, but never equal, zero as $p \downarrow 0$.

  Thus, we have shown that for ${m} \leq 1 $ and for ${m} > 1$ in the limit as $p \downarrow 0$ the consumer facing the risk but no constraint behaves identically to the consumer facing the constraint but no risk. This argument can be generalized to show that for the CRRA utility consumer, spending must always be strictly less than the sum of current wealth and the minimum possible value of human wealth.  Thus, the addition of a risk to the problem can rule out certain levels of wealth as feasible, and can also render either future or past constraints irrelevant, just as the imposition of a new constraint can. 


  \section{Proof of Theorem \ref{thm:CCandPS}}\label{app:CCandPS}

  \begin{proof}
    To simplify notation and without loss of generality, we assume that when an agent faces $n$ constraints and $m$ risks, there are one constraint and one risk for each time period. For example, if $c_{t,n}^{m}$ faces $m$ future risks and $n$ future constraints, then the next period consumption function is $c_{t+1,n-1}^{m-1}$ (and $m = n$). Note that we can transform any problem into this notation by filling in with degenerate risks and non-binding constraints. However, for Theorem \ref{thm:CCandPS} to hold with strict inequality, we need to assume that there is at least one relevant future risk and one relevant constraint. 
    
    We know that either the introduction of risk or a introduction of a constraint results in a counterclockwise concavification of the original consumption function. However, this is only true when we introduce risks in the absence of constraints (Lemma \ref{lem:ccrisk}) and when we introduce constraints in the absence of risk (see Theorem \ref{thm:lcip2}). In this proof, we therefore need to show that the introduction of all risks and constraints is a counterclockwise concavification of the linear case with no risks and constraints.
    
    Here is our proof strategy. We define a set 
    \begin{align}
      \mathcal{P}_{t,n}^{m-1} = \{ {m} | c_{t,n}^{m-1}({m})-c_{t,n}^{m}({m})>c_{t,0}({m})-c^{1}_{t,0}({m}) \} \label{eq:whatcanbesaid_proof}
    \end{align}
    where Theorem \ref{thm:CCandPS} holds in period $t$ when we introduce a risk at the beginning of period $t+1$. This is defined as the set where precautionary saving induced by a risk that is realized at the beginning of period $t+1$ is greater in the presence of all risks and constraints than in the unconstrained case.
    
    In order to show that the set $\mathcal{P}_{t,n}^{m-1}$ is non-empty, we build it up recursively, starting from period $T$ and adding one constraint or one risk  for each time period. The key to the proof is to understand that the introduction of risks or constraints will never fully reverse the effects of all other risks and constraints, even though they sometimes reduce absolute prudence for some levels of wealth because risks and constraints can mask the effects of future risks and constraints. Hence, the new consumption function must still be a counterclockwise concavification of the consumption function with no risks and constraints for some levels of wealth. 
    
    Since a counterclockwise concavification increases prudence by Lemma \ref{lem:CCToPrud}, and higher prudence increases precautionary saving by Lemma \ref{lemma:kimpratt}, our required set can be redefined as 
    \begin{align*} \mathcal{P}_{t,n}^{m-1} = \{{m} | c_{t,n}^{m-1}({m}) \text{ is a counterclockwise concavification of } c_{t,0}({m}) \text{ and } c_{t,n}^{m-1}({m}) >
      {m} 	\}\end{align*}
    where we add the last condition, $c_{t,n}^{m-1}({m}) > w$ to avoid the possibility that some constraint binds such that the agent does not increase precautionary saving. In words: $\mathcal{P}_{t,n}^{m-1}$ is the set where the consumption function is a counterclockwise concavification of $c_{t,0}({m})$ and no constraint is strictly binding. We construct the set recursively for two different cases: CARA and all other type of utility functions. We start with the non-CARA utility functions. 
    
    First add the last constraint. The set $\mathcal{P}^{0}_{T,1}$ is then 
    \[\mathcal{P}^{0}_{T,1} = \emptyset \]%  \[\left\{ w| {m} < \omega_{T,1}  \right\}\]
    since we know that $c_{T,1}({m})$ is a counterclockwise concavification of $c_{T,0}({m})$ around $\wAlt_{T,1}$ but that the consumer is constrained below this point.
    
    We next add the risk at the beginning of period $T$. To construct the new set, we note three things. First, by Lemma \ref{lem:recursive},  (strict) consumption concavity is recursively propagated for all values of wealth where there is a positive probability that the constraint can bind, i.e. 
    \[\{{m}_{T-1} | \wAlt_{T-1,1} \in \left[{m}_{T-1} - c_{T-1,1}^1({m}_{T-1}) + {y}_{T} + \underline{\zeta} ,{m}_{T-1} - c_{T-1,1}^1({m}_{T-1}) + {y}_{T} + \bar{\zeta}\right] \}\]
    has property strict CC, while it has non-strict property $CC$ for all possible values of ${m}_{T-1}$. Further, we know from Theorem \ref{thm:riskandconstraints} (rearrange equation \eqref{eq:ineq}) that
    \begin{align*}{c}_{T-1,1}^1({m})  & \leq c_{T-1,1}({m}) - c_{T-1,0}({m}) + {c}_{T-1,0}^1({m}) \\ &\leq c_{T-1,0}({m}) - c_{T-1,0}({m}) + c_{T-1,0}({m}) = c_{T-1,0}({m}).\end{align*}
    Third, we know that $c_{T-1,1}^{1}({m})' \geq c_{T-1,0}'({m})$ since ${c}_{T-1,1}^1({m}) < c_{T-1,0}({m})$ for ${m} \leq \wAlt_{T-1,1}^1$, $\lim_{{m}\rightarrow \infty} c_{T-1,1}^1({m}) - c_{T-1,0}({m}) = 0$, and that $c_{t,1}^1({m})$ is concave while $c_{t,0}({m})$ is linear. Hence, $c_{T-1,1}^1$ is a counterclockwise concavification of $c_{T-1,0}$ around the minimum value of wealth when the constraint will never bind and the new set is
    \begin{align*}\mathcal{P}_{T-1,1}^1 = \{{m}_{T-1} | \wAlt_{T-1,1} \in \left[{m}_{T-1} - c_{T-1,1}^1({m}_{T-1}) + {y}_{T} + \underline{\zeta}, {m}_{T-1} - c_{T-1,1}^1({m}_{T-1}) + {y}_{T} + \bar{\zeta}\right]   \\ \wedge c_{T-1,1}^1({m}) > {m}_{T-1}\}.\end{align*}
    
    We can now add the next constraint. The consumption function now has two kink points, $\wAlt_{T-1,1}^1$ and $\wAlt_{T-1,2}^1$. We know again from Lemma \ref{lem:recursive} that consumption concavity is preserved when we add a constraint, and strict consumption concavity is preserved for all values of wealth at which a future constraint might bind. Further, we know from Theorem \ref{thm:riskandconstraints} that 
    \begin{align*}c_{T-1,2}^1({m}) &\leq c_{T-1,2}({m}) - c_{T-1,1}({m}) + c_{T-1,1}^1({m}) \\ &\leq c_{T-1,1}({m}) - c_{T-1,1}({m}) + c_{T-1,1}({m}) = c_{T-1,1}({m}) \leq c_{T-1,0}({m}). \end{align*}
    Third, $c_{T-1,2}^1({m}) < c_{T-1,0}({m})$,  $\lim_{{m}\rightarrow\infty} c_{T-1,2}^1({m}) - c_{T-1,0}({m}) = 0$, and we know that if $c_{T-1,2}^1({m})$ is concave while $c_{T-1,0}({m})$ is linear, then $c_{T-1,2}'^{1}({m}) \geq c_{T-1,0}'({m})$. $c_{T-1,2}^1({m})$ which is a counterclockwise concavification of $c_{T-1,0}({m})$ around the minimum level of wealth at which the first constraint will never impinge on time $T-1$ consumption, $\bar{\wAlt}_{T-1,1}^1$, and the new set is
    \[\mathcal{P}_{T-1,2}^1 = \{{m}_{T-1}| {m}_{T-1} \leq \bar{\wAlt}_{T-1,1}^1 \wedge c_{T-1,2}^1({m}) > {m}_{T-1} \}.\]
    
    It is now time to add the next risk. The argument is similar. We still know that (strict) consumption concavity is recursively propagated and that $\lim_{{m}\rightarrow \infty} c_{T-2,2}^2({m}) - c_{T-2,0}({m}) = 0$. Further, we can think of the addition of two risks over two periods as adding one risk that is realized over two periods. Hence, the results from Theorem \ref{thm:riskandconstraints} must hold also for the addition of multiple risks so we have
    \begin{align*}c_{T-2,2}^2({m}) &\leq c_{T-2,2}({m}) - c_{T-2,1}({m}) + c_{T-2,1}^2({m}) \\ &\leq c_{T-2,1}({m}) - c_{T-2,1}({m}) + c_{T-2,1}({m}) = c_{T-2,1}({m}) \leq c_{T-2,0}({m}). \end{align*}
    Hence, we again know that $c_{T-2,2}'^{2}({m}) \geq c_{T-2,0}'({m})$. $c_{T-2,2}^2({m})$ is thus a counterclockwise concavification of $c_{T-2,0}({m})$ around the level of wealth at minimum value of wealth when the last constraint will never bind. The new set is therefore
    \[\mathcal{P}_{T-2,2}^2 = \{{m}_{T-2} | {m}_{T-2} - c_{T-2,2}^2({m}_{T-2}) + {y}_{T-1} + \zeta_{T-1} \in \mathcal{P}_{T-1,2}^1 \wedge c_{T-2,2}^{2}({m}) < {m} \}.\]
    
    
    Doing this recursively and defining $\bar{\wAlt}_{t,1}^{m-1}$ as the minimum value of wealth beyond which constraint $1$ will never bind, the set of wealth levels at which Theorem \ref{thm:CCandPS} holds can be defined as
    \[\mathcal{P}_{t,n}^{m-1} = \{{m}_{t} | {m}_{t} \leq \bar{\wAlt}_{t,1}^{m-1} \wedge c_{t,n}^{m-1}({m}) > {m} \}\]
    In words, precautionary saving is higher if there is a positive probability that some future constraint could bind and the consumer is not constrained today. 
    
    The last requirement is to define the set also for the CARA utility function. The problem with CARA utility is that $\lim_{{m}\rightarrow \infty} c_{t,n}^{m-1}({m}) - c_{t,0}({m}) = - k^{m-1} \leq 0$ where $k^{m-1}$ is some positive constant. We can therefore not use the same arguments as in the preceding proof. However, by realizing that equation \eqref{eq:ineq} in the CARA case can be defined as
    \begin{align*}
      c_{t,n+1}({m}) - \tilde{c}_{t,n+1}({m}) - \tilde{k} &\geq c_{t,n}({m})-\tilde{c}_{t,n}({m}) -  \tilde{k} \geq 0 
    \end{align*}
    where the last inequality follows since precautionary saving is always higher than in the constant limit in the presence of constraints. We can therefore rearrange to get
    \begin{align*}
      \tilde{c}_{t,n+1}({m})  &\leq c_{t,n+1}({m}) - \tilde{k} \leq c_{t,n}({m}) - \tilde{k} \leq c_{t,0} - \tilde{k}	\end{align*}
    which implies that the arguments in the preceding section goes through also for CARA utility with this slight modification. 
    
  \end{proof}
