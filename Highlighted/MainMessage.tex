    This is where we will put the ``main message''.

    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Result 1: Liquidity constraints cause consumption concavity.
    \item Implication: Liquidity constraints and risks are very similar, both cause consumption concavity - and consumption concavity is what causes prudence and precautionary saving.
    \item Hence, liquidity constraints also cause more precautionary saving to an immediate risk.
    \item At last, the most general results: the consumption function is concave in the presence of all future risks and constraints; thus precautionary saving is higher in a model with risks and constraints than in a setting where there are no constraints or risks.
    \end{enumerate}
