      We provide the analytical explanation of strong interactions between precautionary saving and liquidity constraints that are regularly observed in numerical solutions to consumption/saving models.  The effects of constraints and of uncertainty spring from the same cause: concavification of the consumption function, which can be induced either by constraints or by uncertainty.  Concavification propagates back to consumption functions in prior periods.  But, surprisingly, once a linear consumption function has been concavified by the presence of either risks or constraints, the introduction of \textit{additional} concavifiers in a given period can \textit{reduce} the precautionary motive in earlier periods at some levels of wealth.
